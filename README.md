DOU FN is an open-source project created from scratch, to help developers write a more readable and high-performance code using functional programming.

I have implemented a lot of useful functions that will bring us more efficient code and writing less.

Using some paradigms like:

- Asynchronous - Synchronous control and Polymorphism
- Lazy loading of data using generators
- Functions using Concurrency

I hope you enjoy this library and if you have any questions or doubts, don't hesitate to contact [me](mailto:cesar.becerra@digitalonus.com).
